# WetWorld (rain wetness, puddles, splashes, wet streaks and puddle reflections)

## 1. Purpose
While it rains outdoors, the ground, roads and rock go wet and darker where the rain reaches them, with glossy highlights. Puddles form in hollows and on flat ground, and their surfaces ripple, reflect the sky and clouds, pick up the sun and nearby lamps, and show the scene above them (screen-space reflections). Rain splashes flicker on flat wet ground, and thin wet streaks run down walls. Surfaces under roofs or cover stay dry. The effect also feeds a small "cover test" (is something above the player?) that the first-person weapon's rain drops use. Water surfaces and distant ground are left alone.

## 2. When it runs
- Enabled by [Shaders.WetWorld.Status] Enabled (default true).
- Per frame the wet pass draws when any of these holds: the rain amount above zero (TESR_WetWorldData x), the puddle amount above zero (TESR_WetWorldData z), or the persistent cover map still holds wet spots. It also needs the player to be outdoors and not underwater.
- Rain amount: the rain effect's animator (Precipitations). It rises to 1 over 0.05 game hours when rain starts and falls to 0 over 0.07 game hours when it stops. With RainStateGuard on it is driven every frame by the rain state (section 11), also while Precipitations is off.
- Puddle amount: its own animator, in game hours, set by [Shaders.WetWorld.Main] Increase and Decrease. Both default to 0 (so puddles appear and vanish at once: true only with RainStateGuard on, section 11). When rain starts it rises to 1 over Increase; when rain stops it falls to 0 over Decrease.
- The orthographic shadow map is requested while the rain or puddle amount is above zero, and while the persistent map is active.
- Weather flag: the game's rainy weather, or [Shaders.Precipitations.Main] ForceRain (default false), which makes the game count as rainy outdoors.
- Frame order (src/core/ShaderManager.cpp): in the material-effects block, after the blood-flow pass and before the fog and beam pass. Just before the wet pass, the cover test (below) runs when [Shaders.WetWorld.Main] HudDrops is above zero, the rain amount is above zero, the player is outdoors, and not underwater. The persistent cover map updates earlier in the frame, before the snow accumulation pass.
- The wet pass does not test for menus; whether it draws in a menu is not confirmed here.

## 3. Inputs
### Textures (sampler slot = the register number in the D3D9 shader)
| Slot | Name | Holds | Filtering / addressing |

| s1 | TESR_DepthBuffer | combined linear depth (view distance over far distance) | linear, clamp |
| s2 | TESR_SourceBuffer | the frame before this effect (the scene); the wet pass reads it for the refracted colour and for reflections | linear, clamp |
| s3 | TESR_RippleSampler | rain ripple texture, file Precipitations\ripples.dds (per texel: a mask, two encoded direction values, and a phase offset) | linear mips, wrap |
| s4 | TESR_OrthoMapBuffer | the sun's orthographic shadow depth map | linear, clamp |
| s5 | TESR_NormalsBuffer | world normals of the frame (encoded) | point, clamp |
| s6 | TESR_PointShadowBuffer | point and sun shadow mask (red = sun shadow, green = point-light shadow) | linear, clamp |
| s7 | TESR_DepthBufferViewModel | depth of the first-person weapon and hands | linear, clamp |

| s13 | TESR_CoverMapBuffer | persistent cover map (wet, puddle water, snow, trodden snow per spot); persistent techniques only | wrap, no mips |

The Vulkan wet pass (section 7) binds the same textures in a different order: binding 0 the blurred wet map, 1 the source picture, 2 depth, 3 view-model depth, 4 ortho map, 5 normals, 6 point shadow, 7 ripples, 8 splash, 9 splash normals, 10 cloud, 11 puddle normals, 12 streaks. The D3D9 slot numbers and the Vulkan binding numbers are not the same.

## 5. Passes and outputs
| Technique (index) | Passes | Used when |
|---|---|---|
| unnamed (0) | wet map, blur across, blur down, wet pass (no fast path, original trace) | FastPaths off, no fixed trace |
| CoverTestTechnique (1) | cover test (one pass) | the first-person cover test (HudDrops) |
| FastPathsTechnique (2) | wet map, blur across, blur down, wet pass (fast) | FastPaths on, no fixed trace |
| FixedTraceTechnique (3) | the same, wet pass with the fixed trace (not fast) | FixedReflectionTrace on, FastPaths off |
| FixedTraceFastPathsTechnique (4) | the same, wet pass with the fixed trace and fast | FixedReflectionTrace on, FastPaths on |
| PersistentTechnique (5) | the same, wet pass fast and reading the cover map | Persistent on, FixedReflectionTrace off |
| PersistentFixedTraceTechnique (6) | the same, fixed trace, fast, reading the cover map | Persistent on, FixedReflectionTrace on |

The C++ picks the technique (MainTechnique and the persistent variant). Each technique's passes are drawn into the frame chain.

Pass outputs:
- Wet-map pass: writes (red) puddle coverage in hollows and on near-flat ground, (green) flat wetness: the ground that is open to the sun and tilted slightly up, and (blue) flat wetness on very flat ground. Alpha 1. Pixels beyond 0.9 of the ortho reach write zero in all channels.
- Blur passes (across, then down): a depth-aware five-tap blur of the wet map (the centre and the taps at one and two texels, with weights 0.375, 0.25 and 0.0625, and a depth tolerance that keeps the blur on one surface). Writes the blurred values, alpha 1. Both passes must cover every pixel.
- Wet pass: writes the final picture at full frame size (alpha 1, except the first-person early exit, which keeps the base colour's alpha). It may write the game target directly. The picture is the scene with wetness, puddles, splashes and streaks applied, and clamped as KeepHighlights says.
- Cover test (technique 1): draws one white pixel only if it is kept by the test (below); the C++ counts the kept pixels with an occlusion query, and a non-zero count means "covered".

## 6. Behaviour details
### Distance, water and the far cut-off
- The effect stops at 0.9 of the ortho map's reach (TESR_OrthoData x). Beyond that the wet pass returns the scene (plus any splash addition) and nothing else. Between the near range and that limit the wetness fades with a smooth curve (full near, zero at the limit).
- Water exclusion: a very flat, upward-facing surface (its normal within about 0.99 of straight up) whose height lies within a band of the water level (the band is the pixel's depth over far distance times 500 game units, each side) is returned unchanged.

### Roofs and open ground
- Roof test: a pixel is "open" when the ortho map shows nothing between it and the sun. A point outside the ortho map counts as covered (it gets no rain wetness), which differs from the snow effects, which count outside as open.
- Flat wetness (green channel) requires open ground and a slope tilted up between cosine 0.65 and 0.92. The very flat channel (blue) requires cosine 0.90 to 0.97.
- A first-person pixel (view-model test) gets no ground wetness or puddles.

### Puddles
- Puddle coverage comes from hollows: the ortho depth is compared with eight neighbours at a radius of 100 game units (scaled to the map). A pixel is concave when it lies well below its ring (curvature test, smooth step 0.25 to 2.0 on the depth difference scaled by the depth scale). The concave test is kept only on nearly flat ground (tilt filter: cosine between 0.707 and 0.906 of the height normal), where the neighbours do not jump in depth by more than about 40 to 80 units (edge filter, fading between those), and where the pixel lies on the surface the map saw (tolerance 0.0005 in ortho depth).
- The coverage is then blurred by the wet-map blur (radius 12) and multiplied by a tilt filter on the surface's up component (cosine between 0.707 and 0.906), by the view-model exclusion (puddles do not form under the weapon), and by the puddle fill.
- Puddle fill: the puddle amount (TESR_WetWorldData z, or the persistent puddle water) is mapped through a smooth step from 0.08 to 1.0.
- Puddle rim: a thin darkened band at the edge of each puddle (rim darkening 0.15, reflection boost 0.08) from a quadratic of the puddle mask.
- Puddle depth: a value derived from the puddle mask (squared, after a 1.15 scale) tints the puddle base slightly toward blue (factor 0.25) and darkens it by up to 0.18, so the middle of a puddle reads deeper than its edge.

### Rain ripples and swell
- Four ripple layers sample the ripple texture at scales 120 game units (times 1.0, 1.1, 1.3 and 1.5), each moving on the clock at its own rate (about 0.96 to 0.99 times the clock). Their strength is the raw rain value times 1, 0.75, 0.5 and 0.25 (saturated, times 4), so the rain's ripples build up as it intensifies.
- The ripples bend the surface normal in XY. Ripples apply where the surface is flat (the flat ripple mask, cosine 0.65 to 0.92) and where rain can reach (rain visibility: rain fade times the roof test).
- Puddle swell: two sine waves across the world's X and Y directions (wavelengths about 24 to 31 game units) add a small slope to puddle normals, with amplitude 0.003 scaled by the puddle mask to the power 1.35, fading out between 400 and 1800 game units.
- Puddle texture normals: two samples of the puddle normal map at 256 game units per repeat (the second at 1.37 times the scale, drifting the other way), blended 65:35, add slope scaled by the puddle strength (0.25 for puddles, a smaller flat value for wet ground) and by the near-distance fade.

### Splashes
- Splashes: each cell of 8 world units (8 units is the splash cell size) may hold one splash, chosen by a hash and a density equal to the rain amount times the roof test times 0.395. Each splash plays a 16-frame sheet, one cycle every 1/1.35 clock units, with a fade in and out, at a random position within the cell with a small jitter. The first-person weapon uses the same sheet at a scale of 0.28 of the world scale, with its own size variation.
- Splash strength: multiplied by the splash alpha, the flat-ground mask, the rain visibility and a distance fade (full to 1200 game units, zero at 2000). Splash brightness is contrast-stretched and mixed 35 percent toward white, then scaled by 0.17 and by 0.6.
- Splashes also bend the normal (strength 2.2) and refract the picture slightly (0.35 of the refraction scale).

### Vertical wet streaks
- Streaks run down near-vertical surfaces (strongest where the absolute up component is below about 0.55, fading out by 0.8), only under the roof test and in rain. They fade with distance between 800 and 1000 game units.
- The streak texture is projected on the wall in world units of 64 by 90, in two flow groups per lane (eight lanes per texture unit) with random speeds between 0.45 and 1.65 times 12 units per clock unit. The two projections are weighted by the surface's facing.
- Streaks darken the base colour by 0.45 times the streak mask, add a normal offset (strength 0.25), and add a specular term (exponent 80 for the sun and 30 for lamps, strength 1.2), limited to 0.25 times the mask.

### Puddle colour and reflection
- Refraction: the puddle shows the scene shifted by its normal (scale 50 game units, reduced on puddles to 0.35 of that, limited to 0.75 of the scale), using the source picture; a view factor reduces it at steep angles.
- Sky reflection: the sky colour is taken from the sky functions at the reflection direction; Fresnel-style weight with a minimum of 0.12 (power 5), strength 0.55, maximum blend 0.28, brightness 0.55, and the luma is limited to the base's luma (floor 0.015, scale 0.65).
- Cloud reflection: the cloud texture (256 game units per repeat, drifting slowly, contrast 15) is added over the sky colour with brightness 1.65 and strength 0.38.
- Sun highlight: specular with the sun direction, exponent 80 to 200 on wet ground and 700 on puddles, scaled by the sun height (0.25 to 0.70), the shadow mask and the sun colour; limit 1.95 (1.9 on puddles); the puddle strength multiplies it by 2.25.
- Lamp highlights: 12 shadow-casting and 12 other lamps, each with attenuation (one minus the distance over radius, squared), specular exponent 30, limited to 0.9 (1.8 on puddles) after the puddle strength of 2.5.

### Screen-space reflections (puddles)
- A short ray march in view space: 8 steps, the far travel is 1800 game units with a squared step spacing, with a surface bias of 3 units along the normal. The normal used for reflections is partly the puddle normal (influence 0.25).
- Original trace: the source notes say the original march does not stop on the GPU (its loop exits do not work), so as written it produces no reflection. Fixed trace (FixedReflectionTrace on): the first depth crossing counts as a hit; a hit is taken only where the ray is behind the surface by no more than 24 game units (plus 30 percent of the step), it is not the first-person weapon, it is at least four pixels from the source, and it lies on screen; the hit's visibility fades with distance (full to 0.65 of 1800, floor 0.25) and near the screen edge (over the outer 5 percent).
- Reflection blend: 0.55 of the traced colour, weighted by the hit's visibility. The reflection is strongest at grazing angles, is removed as the camera looks steeply down onto the surface (the angle fade runs from cosine 0.2 to 0.4 of the view against up), and is absent in the top third of the screen, full from two thirds of the way down.
- Puddle reflections are not used on the first-person weapon or the view model.

### Rain amount and the rain flag (a quirk to keep or fix deliberately)
- The wet pass computes its rain amount as the rain value divided by the rainy flag (floored at 0.0001), then clamps to 0..1. When it is raining the flag is 1, so the amount is simply the rain value. When it is not raining the flag is 0, so the amount becomes 1 as soon as the rain value exceeds about 0.0001. In practice, after rain stops the wetness and ripples stay at full strength for the whole rain fade-out (about 0.07 game hours) and drop out when the value reaches zero. Puddles, which use the puddle amount, fade on their own schedule (Decrease).
- The wetness itself uses a smooth step from 0.05 to 0.35 on the amount (rain fade), then multiplies the roof test.

### Persistent wetness and puddles (Persistent on, techniques 5 and 6)
- The flat wetness comes from the cover map's wet value per spot (instead of the rain fade), and puddle fill from the cover map's puddle water (instead of the puddle amount).
- The ripples, splashes and wall streaks still follow the rain falling now.
- Persistent techniques always use the fast pass (with or without the fixed trace).

### Surface classes (2026-11-12: PuddlesLandOnly, WeaponRainHandOff, ReflectionsOwnPuddles)
- The wet-map pass writes a class per pixel into the wet map's alpha; the blur passes hand the centre pixel's alpha on unblurred; the wet pass reads it. Values: 1 everything (the value everywhere while the keys are off), 1.5 everything except the puddle's own mirror image, 0.5 the wet look without puddles or puddle reflections, 0 nothing.
- The class comes from TESR_MaterialBuffer (sampler s14 on D3D9, binding 5 of the Vulkan wet-map pass; point sampled): red = class (1 rigid object, 2 worn gear, 3 cloth, 4 land, 5 plants, 6 skin, plus 0.49 times metal), green = the drawn piece's bound radius, alpha = written. Class and radius are divided by alpha clamped to 0.5 to 1 (the buffer resolved from MSAA holds averages). It is read only while the mode is above 0 and TESR_MaterialBufferData x is 1 (the Vulkan path gets the mode as 0 from the C++ instead).
- Mode 1: land, rigid objects with radius at or above PuddlesMinObjectSize, and unwritten pixels = 1; smaller rigid objects, cloth, plants = 0.5; worn gear and skin = 0. Mode 2: land = 1; worn gear and skin = 0; everything else and unwritten pixels = 0.5. Mode 2 needs the Terrain shaders on (the only writer of class 4); otherwise the C++ sends mode 1.
- First-person pixels: 1, or 0 with WeaponRainHandOff acting (TESR_WetWorldLook y carries the mode plus 4).
- ReflectionsOwnPuddles acting (TESR_WetWorldLook w = 1): pixels of class 1 become 1.5.
- The wet pass uses only floor, ceil and frac of the alpha: puddle allowed = floor(a); wet allowed = max(floor(a), ceil(frac(a))); own reflection allowed = floor(a) x (1 - 2 frac(a)). Its largest variant (technique 6) sits at the 224 constant registers of ps_3_0: one more uniform or literal there fails the compile. Wet allowed multiplies the roof test (so ripples, splashes, flat wetness and streaks follow it); puddle allowed multiplies the puddle coverage (also in the wet-map pass, before the blur); own reflection allowed multiplies the screen-space reflection mask and the sky / cloud mix.

### First-person weapon and view-model
- The view-model test marks first-person pixels: a pixel is first-person when the view-model depth is closer than the normal depth test (normal depth: view-model depth below 0.9; reversed depth: view-model depth above 0.01). It uses the reversed-depth flag (TESR_DepthConstants z).
- First-person pixels get a separate composition: the base picture refracted slightly by the ripple normals, blended by the ripple mask, with no puddle, sky, streak or reflection work. Water exclusion and the far cut-off still apply to them first.
- The cover test (technique 1) keeps a single pixel: it is drawn at a point 48 game units above the player, in the sun's ortho map. It is kept only where that point is inside the map and lies below the map's top surface by more than 0.003 (so something lies above the player's head). Outside the map it is not kept, so the count stays zero and the player counts as not covered. The result is read a frame or two later (through an occlusion query), and the rain drops on the weapon use it.

### Cross-cutting behaviour
- Render-rectangle frames: texture coordinates for the depth, the ortho map and the reflection are mapped into the drawn part of the target (RenderScale). The refraction offset is scaled to native frames.
- Jitter: the wet pass takes no jitter offset (it uses the picture as the frame has it).
- Reversed depth: the combined depth buffer is linear and unaffected, but the first-person test and the view-model depth depend on the reversed-depth flag (TESR_DepthConstants z).
- HDR vs LDR: the pass runs before the tonemapper (KeepHighlights). Its output can exceed 1 when KeepHighlights is on; the picture is display-referred otherwise. Colour changes are done in linear space (sRGB curve), and the output is converted back.
- NaN / inf guards: divisions use a floor (1e-4 or 1e-6, or a max with a small value); exponents apply to saturated inputs; the half vectors and normals normalise; the streak colour divides by a floored alpha.
- Things that look wrong if missed: wet ground under roofs (roof test); wet sky or water (far and water tests); puddles on steep slopes (tilt filter); puddles that reflect the wrong place (SSR thickness and refinement); hard-edged reflection patches at the screen edge (edge fade); rain wetness that stays after the rain (rain amount); streaks on flat ground (up-component range); highlights clipped on puddles (highlight limits and KeepHighlights).

## 7. Vulkan path
- Shaders: src/hlsl/NewVegas/Compute/WetWorldMap.frag (the wet map and its two blur passes, passIndex 0, 1, 2), src/hlsl/NewVegas/Compute/WetWorld.frag (the wet pass, with mode bit 0 = fast, bit 1 = fixed trace) and src/hlsl/NewVegas/Compute/WetWorldCommon.glsl (the shared constants block, included by both). Compiled forms: WetWorld.spv and WetWorldMap.spv in the same folder. Pass names requested: "WetWorldMap" (the three map passes) and "WetWorld" (the wet pass).
- Selection (src/core/EffectRecord.cpp, EffectRecord::Render, and this effect's ExtRender): the Vulkan path runs only for techniques 2, 3 and 4, and only when [Main.Main.Performance] NvrDxvkPasses is on, the frame is not a render-rectangle frame, the Vulkan extension is available, the effect name is not in NvrDxvkKeepD3D9, and the source buffer is the frame's source surface with the needed textures present. Technique 0 (the original pass), the cover test (1), and the persistent techniques (5 and 6) always run as D3D9 passes. With FastPaths on and NvrDxvkPasses on, the normal frame therefore runs the Vulkan path (technique 2, or 4 with the fixed trace).
- The C++ side is src/effects/WetWorld.cpp, ExtRender. It creates the two pipelines once, copies the constants as the D3D9 constant table holds them (matrices are transposed into the block so that the shader's matrix products match the D3D9 meaning), and draws: the map pass, two blur passes (each reads the image the previous pass committed), then the wet pass (which may write the game target directly). Failure before the first pass returns false (D3D9 runs); after the first pass has drawn, a later failure keeps what is on the target.
- Textures, wet map passes: set 1, bindings 0 to 4 (rendered, depth, view-model depth, ortho map, normals). Wet pass: set 1, bindings 0 to 12 as listed in section 3.
- Samplers: four samplers in order, each addressed by a push-block index at offsets 0, 4, 8 and 12: linear clamp (0), point clamp (1, the normals), linear mips wrap (2, the ripple, streak and puddle normal and cloud textures), linear mips clamp (3, the splash sheets). The wet map passes use the first two.
- Uniform block: set 2, binding 0, std140, 1376 bytes (checked by the source), with these fields in order: shadowToLight, projection, invProjection, view, invView (mat4 each); cameraData; depthConstants; cameraPosition; reciprocalResolution; gameTime; sunDirection; sunPosition; sunAmount; sunColor; sunAmbient; skyData; skyColor; skyLowColor; horizonColor; orthoData; waterSettings; wetWorldData; wetWorldLook (each vec4); lightPosition[12]; shadowLightPosition[12]; lightColor[24].
- Push block (32 bytes):
  - wet map passes: four sampler indices (0, 4, 8, 12 bytes: linear clamp, point clamp, unused, unused) then passIndex (0 wet map, 1 blur across, 2 blur down).
  - wet pass: sampler indices (linear clamp, point clamp, mip wrap, mip clamp) then mode (bit 0 fast, bit 1 fixed trace).
- The Vulkan wet pass has no original reflection trace (technique 0 is not on the Vulkan path). Its fast variant traces only when the fixed trace is on, as the D3D9 fast path does.

## 8. Look and cost
- Correct look: rain darkens and glosses the wet ground in the open and leaves roofed and dry ground alone; puddles form in hollows and on flat ground, reflecting the sky and clouds, with sun glints and lamp highlights; ripples move with the rain and build up as it intensifies; splashes flicker on flat wet ground at the rain's density; thin streaks run down walls; the picture is not clipped at white around bright highlights (KeepHighlights on); the first-person weapon's surface ripples in the rain; puddles dry after the rain stops (Decrease).
- Typical wrong results: wet ground under roofs (roof test broken); puddles on slopes (tilt filter broken); puddles reflecting the wrong places or hard reflection patches at the screen edge (trace or edge fade broken); wetness that does not dry off when rain ends (rain amount quirk, see section 6); bright highlights clipped flat (KeepHighlights off or highlight limits wrong); splashes or streaks on the wrong surfaces (up-component ranges); a grey film on the whole screen in rain (base colour or the wet blend broken); reflections on water (water band broken).
- Cost class: multi-pass with a per-pixel loop. Map pass plus two blur passes (cheap), then a per-pixel wet pass with about 14 to 20 reads of the ripple, splash, streak and cloud textures, the 24 lamp terms (in the fast path, only where a lamp reaches the pixel, skipped for the whole screen when no lamp is in use), and the reflection march (8 steps with refinement, only on pixels that can reflect). The source notes say FastPaths saves about 1 ms at 2560 by 1440 in rain, and the fixed trace costs about 0.1 to 0.2 ms more in rain.

## 9. Open questions
- The source notes say the original reflection trace (technique 0 and the fast path without the fixed trace) produces no reflection on the GPU, because its loop exits do not work. The Vulkan path follows that behaviour (no trace unless the fixed trace is on). Decide whether the new version should match this, or implement the fixed trace as the intended behaviour.
- The rain-amount quirk (section 6): after rain stops the wetness stays at full for the whole rain fade-out. Confirm whether that is intended before a new shader copies it.
- TESR_WetWorldCoeffs is registered and set from settings (PuddleCoeff_R, G, B and PuddleSpecularMultiplier), but no shader reads it. Those settings are shown as not used. Decide whether to retire them.
- TESR_SunAmount is declared but not read.
- The first-person drops (HudDrops, the HudDrop keys) are compiled into the object shaders (ShaderRecord and the HudRain include), not into this effect; this spec describes only the cover test they depend on. Their own spec is not part of this wave.
- The persistent map (CoverMap.cpp, CoverMap.h, CoverMap.fx.hlsl) is a separate effect that this one reads through the cover map inputs; this spec describes only what the wet pass reads from it.
- The sky's depth value in the combined depth buffer is not confirmed here; the wet pass treats the sky as beyond its far limit (0.9 of the ortho reach).
- Whether the wet pass draws in menus is not confirmed: the effect's own gate has no menu test.

## 10. Status of the wave 3 rewrite (2026-11-02, branch claude/rw3-weather)
- New D3D9 effect: src/hlsl/NewVegas/Effects/WetWorld.fx.hlsl. Same techniques (0 to 6), sampler registers, constant names and pass order as before. Compiles (fx_2_0, all four defines).
- Fixed in the rewrite: the rain-amount quirk (section 6) is gone. The wet amount is the rain animator itself, so wetness, ripples and splashes follow the 0.07 h fade-out. The rainy flag (TESR_WetWorldData.y) is no longer read.
- Fixed trace: implemented as described (first crossing, 24 units behind plus 30 percent of the step, first-person and screen-edge rejects, distance and edge fades). Technique 0, 2 and 5 keep no reflection (the original trace produces none); techniques 3, 4 and 6 use the fixed trace. This matches section 9's open question: the fixed trace is the intended behaviour and the original stays off.
- Interpretations (not in the spec): the far limit is 0.9 of half the ortho width (OrthoData.x / 2 x 0.9); the near range of the fade is half that limit; the flat wetness bands are ramps (up from cosine 0.65 / 0.90, full toward 0.92 / 0.97); the ground darkens by 0.3 when wet; the normal bend strengths for ripples and streaks follow the listed values.
- Vulkan path (Compute/WetWorld*.frag, .spv): NOT written yet. The C++ creates no pipeline then and falls back to D3D9 for every technique.

## 11. The rain state (2026-11-12, src/core/RainState.h, key RainStateGuard)
- Contract: "it rains" and "the ground is wet" are facts of the weather. They do not depend on whether this effect or Precipitations is switched on. Switching this effect off removes its screen pass (puddles, wet look, splashes, streaks) and nothing else.
- Two amounts, both 0 to 1. Rain: up over 0.05 game hours when the weather turns rainy (the game's rainy weather type, or ForceRain), down over 0.07 when it stops. Puddles: up over Increase, down over Decrease (0 = at once).
- One function, RainState::Tick, drives both animators and writes TESR_WetWorldData x / y / z and TESR_RainData x. Every reader calls it: this effect, Precipitations, the land (Terrain.cpp), the objects (PBR.cpp), skin (Skin.cpp), the heat haze (HeatHaze.cpp). PBR's constants update runs every frame whether or not the object shaders are on, so the rain state runs every frame whatever is switched off.
- RainState::Factor = max(rain, puddles): the blend from the Main / Night groups to the Rain / NightRain groups of [Shaders.Terrain.*] and [Shaders.PBR.*], skin's RainWetness, and what turns the heat haze off.
- What it replaces (still the code with RainStateGuard off): each amount was animated inside its own effect's constants update, which does not run for a switched-off effect, so it froze at the moment of the switch. And with Increase / Decrease at 0 (the defaults) the puddle amount took the PREVIOUS target at each change (Animator::Start with no duration): 0 all through the rain, 1 from the moment it stopped and for the rest of the session. The Rain groups, the wet skin, the ortho map and this effect's pass then stayed on after every rain.
- Also handled: a fade restarted half way continues from where it is (it jumped back to its old start), and an animator whose start lies after the game clock (an earlier save loaded during a fade) is set to its target.
- Log lines (prefix "UNOFFICIAL RainState:", at most 60 a session): the mode at the first frame and when the key changes; "the rain started / stopped"; "WetWorld / Precipitations switched on / off" with the factor before and after (the Enabled flags themselves are compared, so every way of switching is seen); "fully wet" and "dry again".
- Changed by default against the builds before it: puddles show during the rain again and go when it stops (with Increase / Decrease 0); with this effect off, rainy weather still brings the Rain setting groups, wet skin and the water's rain ripples; with Precipitations off, this effect still shows the rain's wetness, ripples and splashes.
