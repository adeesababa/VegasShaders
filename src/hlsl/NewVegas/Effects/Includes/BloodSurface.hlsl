// UNOFFICIAL 2026-11-12 BloodFlow Surface ([Shaders.BloodFlow.Surface], off by default; src/effects/BloodFlow/BloodSurface.h).
// Included at the end of BloodFlow.fx.hlsl (it uses that file's helpers, constants and samplers).
// Blood as a thin layer of liquid lying ON the ground or wall, instead of shapes painted into the picture:
//  - Each fresh splat and each bleeding body gets a patch: a square fixed in the world (level for floors, upright for walls)
//    with a cell of a state atlas (TESR_BloodSurface, fp16, two copies). A texel holds r the blood's thickness there (game
//    units), g how dry it is (0 wet, 1 dry), b the real surface's height above the patch's plane, a what is known of that
//    height (0 nothing, 0.25 something tall stands there, 0.5 guessed from its neighbours, 1-8 read that many times).
//  - BloodSurfaceSim (SurfaceSimPS), a step of the simulation for every patch that is still wet, from one copy of the atlas
//    into the other (two steps a frame, so the first copy always holds the newest state):
//      heights: while the patch is on screen each texel finds its surface point in the depth buffer (walking along the
//        patch's normal) and keeps it, averaged over the first reads; what the camera cannot see (behind a rock, under the
//        body) is filled in smoothly from the texels round it. Actors, plants and the first-person weapon are never read
//        (TESR_MaterialBuffer's classes), so a body lying in its own pool is not part of the ground.
//      flow: blood moves to the lower of two neighbouring texels, lower counting the ground's height plus the blood on it
//        (and, on a slope or a wall, how far down the patch the texel is): faster the thicker it is (thickness cubed, as a
//        thin viscous film), never more than a share of what the texel holds, never past level. A thin film stays behind
//        wherever blood has been (the stain), dry ground holds the front back until the blood behind it stands high enough
//        (so the edge creeps on in lobes, not as a ring), blood dries (thin films first) and stiffens as it does, and soaks
//        away slowly. So it runs into cracks, parts round stones, gathers in hollows, and its outline is the ground's.
//      sources: a splat lays its blood down in the first half second, in the shape of the game's own decal (its texture's
//        alpha, where that texture is a loose file; else a drawn blob); a body bleeds for BleedTime under its middle.
//    When a patch's time is up it is frozen: no more steps, only the drawing below.
//  - BloodSurface (SurfacePS): a box round each patch; a pixel in it takes its surface point from the depth buffer, finds
//    its texel and shows the blood there only if that point lies on the height the patch holds (so nothing standing in or
//    passing through the patch is painted) and is ground or a rigid object (never an actor, a plant, the weapon in hand).
//    The colour is the pixel's own, relit: the light that is already there (the picture over the surface's own colour,
//    TESR_AlbedoBuffer; a fixed grey where there is no record) times what a film of blood of that thickness lets through
//    and scatters back. In shadow it is dark, in the sun lit, under a lamp the lamp's colour. Wet blood adds a highlight
//    of the sun (where it is not shaded) and the lamps, and a little of the sky at low angles; dry blood none.
// Limits: a patch is one flat sheet (blood running down a wall stops at its foot, it does not carry on over the floor);
// heights are read only while the patch is on screen; ground finer than a texel (about a game unit) is not seen.
