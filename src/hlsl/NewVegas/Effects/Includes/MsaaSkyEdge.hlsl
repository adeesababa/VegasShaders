// UNOFFICIAL 2026-11-04 the game's MSAA and the effects that treat sky and surfaces apart (VolumetricClouds, VolumetricLight).
// A pixel on an edge against the sky holds samples of both, but its one depth is the nearer surface's (NVR DXVK resolves the nearest
// sample), so an effect that tells sky from surface by depth handled the whole pixel as surface and its sky share kept what the sky
// had before: a rim round every leaf, branch and ridge. TESR_SkyCoverage (core/SkyCoverage.h) holds each pixel's exact sky share,
// from a far-plane quad drawn against the multisampled depth at the end of the world's main list. Only with the game's MSAA
// (TESR_GameMultisample.x > 1); without it nothing is read and SkyShare is 0.
// The includer declares TESR_RenderedBuffer, TESR_ReciprocalResolution and TESR_GameMultisample, includes Depth.hlsl (readDepthLod,
// farZ), defines linearize, and defines MSAA_SKY_EDGE_REG: the sampler register that is this sampler's place among the file's TESR_
// samplers (EffectRecord binds them by that place), so it is included after all of them.
//
// UNOFFICIAL 2026-11-05 alpha cutouts ([Main.Main.Quality] MsaaEdgeFix, TESR_GameMultisample.z; report: the clouds do not respect a lattice
// pylon's cutouts, the volumetric light turns a see-through desert bush solid). With transparency multisampling the game draws its
// cutout meshes (pylon lattices, foliage: the TMS shaders) with alpha to coverage: a pixel where the texture's alpha is 0.4 gets about
// 40 % of its samples, and far off, where the texture's smaller mips average the holes into the bars, the whole outline is such pixels.
// The one depth the effects read is the nearest sample's under NVR DXVK (the whole see-through part reads as solid), sample 0's under
// stock DXVK and native D3D9 (each pixel solid or sky by chance). The share is the exact answer either way, so with the fix every
// pixel takes it: MsaaSkyCoverage below, for sky-by-depth pixels too (sample 0 left those whole sky: the clouds over the bars), with
// the sky behind found from the pixels round it that are all sky by their share (not by depth), out to 8 pixels (a lattice far off is
// all mixed pixels: within 2 pixels there was often none, and the pixel's own colour, part bar, stood in for the sky).
// TESR_GameMultisample: x the game's samples, y 1 = this frame's shares were made (SkyCoverage::Draw), z 1 = the fix on, w the debug
// view (1: red = sky by depth, green = sky share).
