    //    (0.25-1, f_amount.x, a plain amount: on the sun and the ambient alike), which is the tuft's share of the light: part of the colour

    //    behind, 29 % of the bounce rays sent through it): a model for a card lit by its own face, not for a tuft lit as the ground it

    //  - NORMAL: the tuft's lighting normal was right (one per tuft, its axis: about the ground's normal), but CapturedNormalOut turns a
    //    normal that faces away from the camera over: a tuft above the eye (a slope, tall grass close by) was recorded pointing DOWN, and
