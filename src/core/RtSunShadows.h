// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-28 (NVR DXVK) RT sun shadows ([Shaders.ShadowsExteriors.RT]; docs\next\FORK-RT-SUN.md): one ray per pixel
// toward the sun against the ray tracing core's scene (RtCore.h: the 64-bit helper), from the depth and normal buffers, its
// visibility multiplied into the sun shadow buffer after the contact shadows (Mode 0, combine: the cascades stay, the rays add what
// the maps miss), or replacing the cascades inside the RT range (Mode 1: the forward cascade lookups off, the deferred apply fades
// the cascades in only where the rays fade out). Off, or the core not running: exactly the old path.

	// the object / skin / land shaders' own sun lookup. The old Mode 1 switched those lookups off and left the sun to the deferred apply,
	// which scales the finished pixel (ambient and lamp light with the sun's) and which the lamps' mask cancels wherever a lamp reaches:
	// surfaces the trace had in shade came out sunlit. Now Apply packs the traced visibility with the frame's depth into
	// TESR_RtSunForward and the next frame's lookups take it where the depth there is their own point's (else the cascades); the
	// deferred apply keeps only the contact shadows, as it does with the forward lookups running. Off, the forward lookups not compiled
	// ([Shaders.ShadowsExteriors.Main] ForwardShadows off): the old Mode 1.
