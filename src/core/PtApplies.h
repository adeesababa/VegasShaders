// UNOFFICIAL 2026-11-12 (a tester, of path tracing: "a whole swath of shaders and settings do not appear to work ... it's a real
// crapshoot trying to investigate anything"). What each effect does while the path traced picture replaces the scene
// (RtPathTrace::Replacing), as ONE table. Its readers:
//   - the menu (ImGuiManager.cpp): a row's line at the top of the effect's pages, a short tag beside its name in the effects list, and
//     the whole table as a folding block on the Ray tracing page. [Main.Menu.Developer] PathTracingNotes (View > Path tracing notes)
//     turns these off. With path tracing off nothing of it shows.
//   - the session log (LogIfChanged, called once a second from SessionLog::OnFrame): the enabled effects by state, once when the traced
//     picture first replaces the scene and again when the set changes ("PT APPLIES" lines).
// The evidence for every row, with file and line, is docs/PT-WHAT-APPLIES.md: change the two together. Lines are plain and short. A key
// the menu shows is named "Ray tracing > Key"; a key it hides (the Internal list) is named as a settings file key.
